The UI of the scenes is in Catalan, while the code is written in Spanish.

## How to install and open the project
The project is a normal Unity project. To open it, you can just import it through the Unity Hub app. If you don't have it installed, here is how you can open the project:

- Download this repository, for example, by clicking the green Code button and then Download ZIP (if you download it this way, extract it once it downloads)
- Download the Unity Hub App from [https://unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download)
- Open it and log in
- Click the Add button and select the project
- If you don't have installed the Unity editor version 2022.2.2f1, the Unity Hub will prompt you to install it (you must install it to open the project). This will take some time
- Once the editor has installed, the project will open automatically

To open the project at a later time, open the Unity Hub and click the project name in the projects list.


## How to use the project

In the Unity editor window, you will see the project's files at the bottom. At the left of this panel, there is a list of the folders of the project. Click the Sample folder to open it, and its contents will be displayed. To open either the 3D or 4D scene, double-click the Scene3d or Scene4d files, respectively.

Once the scene is opened, you can click the play button at the top of the editor to start the game. To pause it, click the pause button. To stop it, click the play button again.


## How to build the project

Building the project converts it into an app (an exe file) to be opened without installing the Unity Hub or the editor. To build it, click the File button at the top left, and click Build settings. In the window that opens, you can click the Player Settings button to open the settings for the built app. When you are ready to build the project, click the Build button and select the destination folder.
